    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <div class="question">
      What the heck is Quanah?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      An academic publication is forthcoming, but in a nutshell, Quanah is a
      browser-based distributed computer designed especially for scientific
      research.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Why did you pick the name "Quanah"?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      A nice essay is forthcoming. For now, read more
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanah_Parker">here</a>.

    <div class="question">

    <div class="question">
      I pressed "Run" and nothing happened ... ?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Check your browser's development console to see if any results have been
      printed there. If not, try opening the volunteer page in a second tab to
      accelerate the queue a little bit. If it still doesn't come back, let me
      know by filing a report <a href="http://quanah.googlecode.com">here</a>.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Is this an open-source project? If so, where can I find the source code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Yes, it is open-source. The main repository, which uses Mercurial, is
      hosted at <a href="http://quanah.googlecode.com">Google Code</a>, and I
      will probably mirror it on GitHub soon as well.
