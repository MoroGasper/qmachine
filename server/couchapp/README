README --

This directory contains a set of live instructions for building Quanah as a
"CouchApp", a design document automatically written and upload to a CouchDB
instance by a Python tool designed by the authors of CouchDB. Additionally, the
app described by the documents herein demonstrates the use of "filters", which
are not well described by the O'Reilly "Relax" book -- they are key in making
queues for the volunteers' machines to poll for new jobs to run.
