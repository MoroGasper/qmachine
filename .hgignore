# Mercurial "ignore" file -- see hgignore(5).

# .hgignore --
#   This file contains a set of patterns that alter the behavior of Mercurial.
#   Mercurial will ignore every unmanaged file that matches any pattern in an
#   "ignore" file. In this case, I have instructed Mercurial to ignore hidden
#   files created by vim as well as the .couchapprc file, which potentially
#   contains plaintext passwords for use while authenticating file uploads.
