README --

So, here are some instructions for actually using Mercurial; I won't assume you
know how to use it, because until 10 minutes ago, I couldn't get it to work
myself.

    0.  Install Mercurial -- if you're reading this, you probably already did.
    1.  See the directions at http://code.google.com/p/quanah/source/checkout .
    2.  Edit files, then type
            $   hg add
            $   hg commit               # this one is crucial!
    3.  To "push" your changes back to everyone else, type
            $   hg push                 # and then follow the directions.

Now, I'm no expert, but hopefully that helps :-)
