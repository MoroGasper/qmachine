- I realized that the current queue mechanism is vulnerable to "wabbits".

- Do NOT touch the "require_valid_user" tag in "/_config". If you do, you can
  undo the damage as shown:
    $ curl -X PUT http://user:password@foo.couchone.com/_config/couch_httpd_auth/require_valid_user -d '"false"'

- http://blog.couch.io/post/443028592/whats-new-in-apache-couchdb-0-11-part-one-nice-urls

- http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Rewriting_urls

curl -X PUT http://user:password@foo.couchone.com/_config/vhosts/hostname -d \
  '"/db/_design/app/_rewrite"'

A new idea I have is to use '~username' as a rewrite rule to a view/show/filter
function of some variety that shows all the documents written by a user.
