- I realized that the current queue mechanism is vulnerable to "wabbits".

- Does 'jslint' have a bug in it, for methods that begin with "_" ?

- Do NOT touch the "require_valid_user" tag in "/_config". If you do, you can
  undo the damage as shown:
    $ curl -X PUT http://user:password@foo.couchone.com/_config/couch_httpd_auth/require_valid_user -d '"false"'
